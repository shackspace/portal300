This folder contains Portal300 administrative setup.

Usage:

  To export the keys to the portal machine, first create a temporary folder,
  then run ./key-export <that-folder>. After that, copy the files from that
  folder to an USB stick formatted with FAT32, and plug that USB stick into
  the APU machine. The new keys should then be deployed.

First run:

  Run ./initialize.sh to create a new certificate authority. This CA is then
  used to sign future key exports.
  
WARNING:

  If a new CA is created, the firmware of the ESP32s have to be recompiled,
  and the CA has to be updated on the APU machine. Do this only if absolutely
  necessary!
